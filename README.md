# Dictionary module with integrated Parellelization(multi-threading) support to massively enhance the speed of functions such as map or filter on dictionaries and a wide variety of other features, just take a look! 

# DictionaryWorker goes underneath Dictionary as it is replicated onto all Actors when using parallel luau

Parellelization seems to increase speed by around 6 times on 8 threads, I would recommend only using it on dictionaries with heavy calculations or keys at like 100 to 1k (so especially with data systems!)
